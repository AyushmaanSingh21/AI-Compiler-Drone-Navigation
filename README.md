# AI-Compiler-Drone-Navigation
AI Compiler for real-time object detection in drone navigation using ANN and Harmony Search Algorithm.
AI Compiler for Real-Time Object Detection in Drone Navigation

🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI Compiler for Real-Time Object Detection in Drone Navigation using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and the Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA). The AI system detects objects using a deep learning model and optimizes the drone's navigation path using HSA to avoid obstacles and improve flight efficiency.

🔥 Features

Real-Time Object Detection using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model

Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) for optimal path planning

Integration with drone camera feed for obstacle detection

Dynamic path correction based on detected obstacles

Lightweight and efficient AI model suitable for real-time execution

🛠️ Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

https://github.com/AyushmaanSingh21/AI-Compiler-Drone-Navigation

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy

3️⃣ Run Object Detection

python scripts/object_detection.py

4️⃣ Run Path Optimization

Adjust the drone's trajectory to avoid obstacles dynamically.

🧠 How It Works

🎯 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Object Detection

Uses MobileNetV2 to detect objects in real-time.

Processes input from the drone's camera feed.

Identifies obstacles and marks them for avoidance.

📍 Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) for Path Planning

Initializes a population of random paths.

Evaluates path fitness based on distance & obstacle avoidance.

Uses harmony memory consideration, pitch adjustment, and random selection to optimize the flight path.

Outputs the best possible path for the drone to follow.

🔮 Future Improvements

Train a custom ANN model for improved accuracy.

Enhance real-time performance using optimized TensorFlow models.

Integrate with PX4 or AirSim for drone simulation.

Add GPS-based navigation for real-world deployment.
